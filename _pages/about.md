Hi! My name is Jiayu Ma. I am a first - year master's student majoring in Computational Law at Tsinghua University.
My research interests generally lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its interdisciplinary applications, particularly in the context of Computational Law. Since undergraduate studies, I have been involved in research projects focusing on **AI for Law** and **Law for AI**. Currently, I am interested in:

- Developing multi - agent collaboration that enable agents to exchange information in natural language to reach optimal collective decisions
- Exploring the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs to enhance their reliability and transparency
- Building interdisciplinary applications that bridge the gap between law and technology
